# PITOS Experiments

This repository contains code to create tables/figures for the paper **A powerful goodness-of-fit test using the probability integral transform of order statistics (Covington & Miller 2025).** 

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22854](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22854).

The figures and tables in the paper can be generated by running `main.jl`, `Halton.jl`, and `null_distributions.jl`. The `main.jl` file contains a handful of TODO comments that show lines that need to be modified to in order for the code to run quickly. If you want to run it in a reasonable amount of time and get results that are (somewhat) close to those in the paper, I recommend cutting each of the numbers in the TODO lines by a factor of 10 or 100.
